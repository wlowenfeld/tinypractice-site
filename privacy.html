<h1>TinyPractice Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: February 2026</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>TinyPractice is a client management app for therapists and counselors. We are committed to protecting your privacy and the privacy of your clients. This policy explains what data the app collects and how it is handled.</p>

<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<p>All data you enter into TinyPractice — including client names, session notes, appointments, and invoices — is stored exclusively on your device. Your data is not transmitted to, stored on, or accessible by any external server operated by TinyPractice or any third party. We do not have access to your data.</p>

<h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
<p>TinyPractice does not collect analytics, usage data, crash reports, device identifiers, location data, or any personal information. We do not use any third-party analytics or tracking services.</p>

<h2>Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
<p>TinyPractice offers optional paid subscriptions processed through the Apple App Store. Payment processing is handled entirely by Apple. We use RevenueCat to manage subscription status. RevenueCat receives an anonymous user identifier and subscription status from Apple — it does not receive any of the data you enter into the app (client information, session notes, etc.). For more information, see <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/">RevenueCat's privacy policy</a>.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>TinyPractice includes an optional PIN lock feature to restrict access to the app on your device. Because all data is stored locally, the security of your data depends on the security of your device. We recommend enabling a device passcode and keeping your operating system up to date.</p>

<h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
<p>As the sole controller of the data you enter into TinyPractice, you are responsible for ensuring your use of the app complies with any applicable privacy laws, regulations, or professional obligations. TinyPractice is a record-keeping tool and does not provide legal or compliance advice.</p>

<h2>Data Deletion</h2>
<p>You can delete all data at any time from within the app via Settings. Because your data is stored only on your device, deleting the app also removes all associated data. We cannot recover deleted data.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>TinyPractice is not directed at children under 13 and does not knowingly collect information from children.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top of this page reflects the most recent revision.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@tinypractice.app">support@tinypractice.app</a>.</p>
