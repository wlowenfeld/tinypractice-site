    <h1>The Best iPhone App for Solo Therapists in Private Practice (2026)</h1>
    <p>If you run a solo therapy practice, your iPhone is probably with you at all times. Between sessions, in the car, at home after a late appointment &mdash; it's the device you actually use. So it's worth asking: which practice management tools actually work on it, and which ones are just pretending?</p>
    <p>This is a full comparison of every major iPhone app option for therapists in 2026. Not every platform deserves the label. Some have no native iPhone app at all. Others offer a stripped-down mobile companion to a desktop-first product that costs $49 to $99 per month. One was built for iPhone from the start.</p>
    <h2>Why iPhone Matters for iOS Therapy Practice Management</h2>
    <p>The shift to mobile-first practice management isn't a trend &mdash; it's already happened. Solo therapists aren't sitting at a desk all day. They're moving between appointments, fitting notes in during gaps, texting reminders, and checking their calendar from wherever they happen to be. A tool that only works on a desktop isn't meeting you where you work.</p>
    <p><strong>Between-session note-taking</strong> is one of the clearest use cases. The few minutes right after a session &mdash; before the next client arrives, before you forget the details &mdash; are when notes are most accurate. If you have to wait until you're back at a laptop, you're losing something. An iPhone app that lets you write notes immediately, without opening a browser, logging into an account, and waiting for a page to load, is meaningfully better for clinical documentation.</p>
    <p><strong>Scheduling on the go</strong> matters too. Rescheduling a session, checking your week, or booking a new client from your phone should take seconds. Web-based platforms load slowly on mobile, require pinching and zooming, and weren't designed for touch interaction.</p>
    <p><strong>Privacy is the third consideration.</strong> Cloud-based apps transmit your client data to a third-party server every time you open a note or view a record. An app that stores data on-device means your client records never leave your phone &mdash; no breach risk from the vendor's servers, no subprocessors with access to your data, no uncertainty about how your information is stored. For more detail on what this means under HIPAA, see our post on <a href="hipaa-compliant-therapist-app-iphone.html">what HIPAA compliance actually means for a therapist app on your iPhone</a>.</p>
    <h2>Every iPhone App Option for Therapists in 2026</h2>
    <p>Here's an honest look at every major platform therapists use and what their iPhone support actually looks like.</p>
    <h3>TherapyNotes &mdash; No iPhone App</h3>
    <p>TherapyNotes is one of the most widely used practice management platforms for therapists &mdash; and it has <strong>no native iPhone app in 2026</strong>. It is a desktop-first web application. You can access it through Safari on your iPhone, but there's no App Store app, no offline access, and no mobile-optimized interface designed for touch. TherapyNotes raised its solo plan price to $69/mo in December 2025. If iPhone access is important to you, this platform simply doesn't offer it.</p>
    <h3>SimplePractice &mdash; iPhone App, but $49&ndash;99/mo</h3>
    <p>SimplePractice does have a native iPhone app. It's a companion to their web platform, and it covers the core features: calendar, client list, messaging, and documentation. The app works reasonably well for what it does, but it requires an active SimplePractice subscription to function &mdash; there's no standalone version. Pricing starts at $49/mo (Starter), $79/mo (Essential), or $99/mo (Plus), following a 69% price increase in March 2025. The real monthly cost for most solo therapists, including add-on fees, runs closer to $100–130/mo. For therapists who bill insurance or need telehealth built in, SimplePractice is worth considering. For solo private-pay therapists, it's a lot of overhead. See our full breakdown of <a href="simplepractice-alternatives-solo-therapists.html">SimplePractice alternatives for solo therapists</a>.</p>
    <h3>TheraPlatform &mdash; No Native iOS App</h3>
    <p>TheraPlatform is a web-based platform focused on telehealth delivery and documentation. It does not have a native iOS app. Like TherapyNotes, you can access it through a mobile browser, but the experience is not designed for iPhone use, and there's no offline functionality.</p>
    <h3>Jane App &mdash; No Native iOS App</h3>
    <p>Jane App is a popular practice management platform, particularly in Canada. It is web-based and does not have a dedicated native iPhone app. The platform is modern and mobile-responsive, but it is not an iOS app &mdash; it requires an internet connection and runs entirely through the browser.</p>
    <h3>SteadyPractice &mdash; Native iOS, $9.99/mo</h3>
    <p><a href="https://steadypractice.app">SteadyPractice</a> is a native iPhone app built specifically for solo therapists. It was designed for iOS from the start &mdash; not adapted from a web platform. It handles session notes, scheduling, client management, and invoicing. It works offline, stores all data on your device, and costs $9.99/mo (or $79.99/yr). There are no add-on fees, no tiers, and no companion web app required. Your client data never leaves your phone.</p>

    <h2>What Makes SteadyPractice Different for iPhone Therapy Practice Management</h2>
    <p>The distinction that matters most: <strong>SteadyPractice was built for iPhone, not adapted for it.</strong> Every other platform on this list was originally a desktop web application. Their iPhone apps &mdash; where they exist &mdash; are companion apps layered on top of a web product. The core workflows, the data model, the interaction design &mdash; it all started on a browser and was later squeezed into a smaller screen.</p>
    <p>SteadyPractice started as an iOS app. The interaction model is native: gestures, haptics, the iOS navigation patterns you already know. There's no web session running in the background. No login token that expires mid-session. No loading spinner while your notes fetch from a server.</p>
    <p><strong>Works without internet.</strong> You can write a session note, check a client's contact info, or review your schedule with no Wi-Fi and no cell signal. The app doesn't need connectivity to function because it isn't dependent on a server to retrieve your data. For therapists who do sessions at locations with unreliable internet &mdash; or who simply want their workflow to be reliable &mdash; this matters.</p>
    <p><strong>On-device data storage.</strong> Your client records, your session notes, your scheduling data &mdash; all of it lives on your iPhone. It never gets transmitted to SteadyPractice's servers, because there aren't any for your data. This is a fundamentally different privacy posture from cloud-based apps, where your most sensitive clinical information is stored on a vendor's infrastructure and subject to their data handling practices. Learn more about how <a href="therapist-session-notes-without-cloud.html">keeping your session notes off the cloud</a> reduces your risk as a therapist.</p>
    <p><strong>No features you don't need.</strong> SimplePractice has roughly 85 features. A solo private-pay therapist uses about 35 of them &mdash; and pays for all 85. SteadyPractice covers what solo therapists actually use: notes, scheduling, clients, invoicing. Nothing more, nothing less. There's no insurance billing module, no group practice management, no telehealth video infrastructure. If you don't need those things, you shouldn't be paying for them.</p>

    <h2>Who Should Use Which App?</h2>
    <p>Not every platform is wrong for every therapist. Here's a straightforward breakdown:</p>
    <p><strong>If you bill insurance:</strong> You need SimplePractice or TherapyNotes. Insurance billing workflows &mdash; claim submission, ERA processing, remittance &mdash; require the infrastructure these platforms have built. TherapyNotes is desktop-only, so if you want iPhone access alongside insurance billing, SimplePractice is your best option despite the cost.</p>
    <p><strong>If you're solo and private-pay:</strong> SteadyPractice is the clear choice. You get a native iPhone app, offline functionality, on-device data storage, and full practice management for $9.99/mo &mdash; compared to $49–99/mo for a SimplePractice subscription that includes dozens of features built for group practices you'll never use.</p>
    <p><strong>If you need integrated telehealth:</strong> SimplePractice has telehealth built into its platform and a functional iPhone app. If video sessions through the same system as your scheduling and notes is a priority, the higher price point may be justified. TheraPlatform and Jane are also telehealth-focused, but lack native iOS apps.</p>
    <p><strong>If iPhone access is non-negotiable:</strong> Eliminate TherapyNotes, TheraPlatform, and Jane App from consideration immediately. None of them have native iOS apps in 2026. You'd be using a desktop product through a mobile browser.</p>
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3>Does TherapyNotes have an iPhone app?</h3>
    <p>No. As of 2026, TherapyNotes does not have a native iPhone or iOS app. It is a desktop-first web platform only. You can load the TherapyNotes website in Safari on your iPhone, but there is no dedicated app in the App Store, no offline access, and no mobile-optimized experience built for touch. Solo therapists who need iPhone access will need to look at other platforms.</p>
    <h3>What is the best therapy app for iPhone?</h3>
    <p>For solo private-pay therapists, <a href="https://steadypractice.app">SteadyPractice</a> is the best iPhone app for therapy practice management in 2026. It's the only native iOS app in this category built specifically for solo therapists &mdash; not a companion to a desktop web platform. It works offline, stores data on your device, and costs $9.99/mo. For therapists who need insurance billing, SimplePractice has an iPhone companion app alongside its full-featured web platform, starting at $49/mo.</p>
    <h3>Can I manage my therapy practice from my phone?</h3>
    <p>Yes, with the right app. SteadyPractice is designed to run entirely on your iPhone &mdash; session notes, client management, scheduling, and invoicing, all from your phone, with or without an internet connection.
