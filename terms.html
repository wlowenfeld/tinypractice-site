<h1>TinyPractice Terms of Service</h1>
<p>Last updated: February 2026</p>

<h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>By downloading, installing, or using TinyPractice, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the app.</p>

<h2>Description of Service</h2>
<p>TinyPractice is a client management and session tracking tool designed for therapists and counselors. The app stores data locally on your device and provides features for managing clients, logging sessions, scheduling appointments, and creating invoices.</p>

<h2>Subscriptions</h2>
<p>TinyPractice offers a free tier and an optional paid subscription ("TinyPractice Pro"). Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period. You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time through your device's Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions. No refunds will be provided for partial billing periods. Pricing may vary by region and is displayed in the app before purchase.</p>

<h2>Free Tier Limitations</h2>
<p>The free version of TinyPractice limits the number of active clients. Upgrading to TinyPractice Pro removes this limit and unlocks additional features as described in the app.</p>

<h2>Your Data</h2>
<p>All data you enter into TinyPractice is stored locally on your device. You are solely responsible for your data, including maintaining backups and ensuring its security. We do not have access to, and cannot recover, your data.</p>

<h2>Professional Responsibility</h2>
<p>TinyPractice is a record-keeping tool. It does not provide clinical, legal, regulatory, or compliance advice. You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the app complies with all applicable laws, regulations, and professional standards, including but not limited to privacy and data protection requirements in your jurisdiction.</p>

<h2>No Warranty</h2>
<p>TinyPractice is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not warrant that the app will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components. We do not warrant that the app meets any specific regulatory or compliance requirements.</p>

<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the developer of TinyPractice shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of data, loss of profits, or damages arising from your use of or inability to use the app.</p>

<h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
<p>You agree not to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the app; use the app for any unlawful purpose; or attempt to circumvent any subscription or access restrictions.</p>

<h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms. The "Last updated" date at the top reflects the most recent revision.</p>

<h2>Termination</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to terminate or suspend access to the app at any time, without notice, for conduct that we believe violates these terms or is harmful to other users or the app.</p>

<h2>Governing Law</h2>
<p>These terms shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>If you have questions about these terms, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@tinypractice.app">support@tinypractice.app</a>.</p>
